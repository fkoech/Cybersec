->Network mapper
->free open source utility for network discovery and security auditing
->used for task such as:
                      network inventory
                      managing services upgrade shedules
                      monitoring  host or serces uptime
                      used raw ip packets to in novel was to determine what host are avaible on network.
                      what service*application name and version)
                      those hosts are offering
                      what operaing systems(os version are they running)
                      what type of  packet filters/firewalls are running
                      run large networks
                      work fine against single host
                      port scanning mechanism(TCP and UDP)
                      os detection
                      version detection
                      ping sweeps
                      identtify active hosts on your network:
                                     nmap -sp ipaddress/networkaddress(192.168.100.1/24)
                      OS scanning 
                                     nmap -O <target IP>
