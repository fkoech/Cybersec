      Tools that attackers use 
      ------------------------
      -SeaDaddy and seaDuke - used by cyberbears to hack US election.
                            - Those tools were used to generate backdoors into the committee of the part.
      -BackEnergy - Used by the russian hackers
                  - used to explore vulnerability on  SCADA or PLCs or ICs systems that are used on power plants or  water
      -Shamoon, DUqu, flame, darkseoul and wannacry - Tools used for criminal and sponser hackers from government to 
        exploit not only infrastructure, but also data and other  information from businesses
      
      
      Security attacks definitions
      ------------------------------
      -Attack classifications 
                 -passive attacks
                 -active atacks
     -Passive  attacks - eavedropping style of attack
                       - Not detected
                       - traffic analysis - is the second class of passive attack.
                       - Does not looks so much at the payload, but the frequency  and the size of the message.
                       -Message are authenticates - the is a prove that the message is from a specific person.
                       -message passes the  integrity check - no change the in message format
                       -Dangerous  from information.



Security services
-------------------------
-Technical implementation of security policies.
-Network security Essentials, application and standard  written by william Stallings
-IT infrustructure 
-Access controls
-Security services that implement the security policies are implemented by the security mechanism.
-Security mechanisms are the security enforcement point .
-The security service enhancing the security of data processing systems and information trans
fers of an organisations.
-Puropose of security inftrusture is to provide defensive mechanisms against a security attack.
-Security services are designed to enhance our ability to counter the security  that is presented against the enterprise.
-Security service can engage and it's one to many relationship between a service and a
security enforcement point.
-provide authenticity through notorization or withnesses signature plus the non-repudiation
part of that can be accomplished from notorization or licensing.
-ITU(international Telecommunication union it is  the united nations governing body for standard worldwide 
x.800
-Ensures that adequate security of the systems or of data  transfers.
-Authentication - is concerned with ensuring that a communication is authentic.
                -It id the affirmation of identification.
-Authorization - is approve.
-Confidentiality - ensuring that the messages are received as  send  with no duplication, insertion, modifcation, reordering , replay or loss.


Security mechanism 
-----------------------------
-Compination of hardware and software and processes that enhance IP security.
-Principle of the security enforcement point.
-This is the technical implementation of a security policy.
-Security policy describes   how work is done.
-Security  enforcement point or the security mechanism  are the  
 technical implementation of that security policy.
- some examples of those  are protocol suppression for example to turn off the fTP,the security policy would be
 no FTPs allow, 
 -No one authorized large-scale data movements.
 -The security  enforcement  point would be to disable FTP,
 -Aspect of identification, of access control identification, authenication, authorization.
 -Security mechanism : 
                     cryptography
                     digital signature
                     access control
                     Data integrity
                     Authentication exchange
                     traffic padding 
                     routing control
                     notarization
-Security policy is a technical policy that is derived from a logical business polocies.
-Full chain is :
               Business policies
               security  policies
               security  enforcemetn point/security mechanism.
-Classes of users 
                  Privilage users
                  General users
                  
-Privilage users - somebody who can change your security  policy.
-pervasive security mechanism  includes; 
                                  -event detection - that is the core of  Qradar and security intelligence.
                                 - Audit trail- ability to collect security intelligence data  and ensure that
                                  security intelligence  data is available, is protected from unauthorized chain.
                                             - important in the forensic  world
-                                 -Trusted functionality
                                  -security label 
                                  -Security recovery
                                  
                                  


Network security Model
--------------------------
-Objective is to understand  mechanically in terms of processes and in terms of logial decomposition
-Encryption keys - allows the security  related transformation or encryption of the message.
-Security architecture
