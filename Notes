        exploit not only infrastructure, but also data and other  information from businesses
      
      
      Security attacks definitions
      ------------------------------
      -Attack classifications 
                 -passive attacks
                 -active atacks
     -Passive  attacks - eavedropping style of attack
                       - Not detected
                       - traffic analysis - is the second class of passive attack.
                       - Does not looks so much at the payload, but the frequency  and the size of the message.
                       -Message are authenticates - the is a prove that the message is from a specific person.
                       -message passes the  integrity check - no change  in message format.
                       -Dangerous  from information.
     -Active attack - involve some modification of the data stream  or the  creation of a false stories.
                      that can be:
                                 -masquerade - is intuitive, masking of one end  to appearing as another.
                                 -replay
                                 -modification 
                                 -denial of service.
                    -extremely dengerous.
                    -used by man in the middle attack. 
                    -message are modified
                    -Can be detected that the is something anomaly.
                    -Deficult to prevent because  of the diversity of the style of attacks 
                      that come though with that.

Security services
-------------------------
-Technical implementation of security policies.
-Network security Essentials, application and standard  written by william Stallings
-IT infrustructure 
-Access controls
-Security services that implement the security policies are implemented by the security mechanism.
-Security mechanisms are the security enforcement point .
-The security service enhancing the security of data processing systems and information trans
fers of an organisations.
-Purpose of security inftrusture is to provide defensive mechanisms against a security attack.
-Security services are designed to enhance our ability to counter the security  that is presented against the enterprise.
-Security service can engage and it's one to many relationship between a service and a
security enforcement point.
-provide authenticity through notorization or withnesses signature plus the non-repudiation
part of that can be accomplished from notorization or licensing.
-ITU(international Telecommunication union it is  the united nations governing body for standard worldwide 
x.800
-Ensures that adequate security of the systems or of data  transfers.
-Authentication - is concerned with ensuring that a communication is authentic.
                -It id the affirmation of identification.
-Authorization - is approve.
-Confidentiality - ensuring that the messages are received as  send  with no duplication, insertion, modifcation, reordering , replay or loss.


Security mechanism 
-----------------------------
-Stalling  defines ir as Compination of hardware and software and processes that enhance IP security.
-Principle of the security enforcement point.
-Security enforcement - is the implementation of the security policies.
-security policies are derived from business policies.
-Business policies descibe what we are going to do.
-This is the technical implementation of a security policy.
-Security policy describes   how work is done.
-Security  enforcement point or the security mechanism  are the  
 technical implementation of that security policy.
- some examples of those  are protocol suppression for example to turn off the fTP,the security policy would be
 no FTPs allowed  
 -No one authorized large-scale data movements.
 -The security  enforcement  point would be to disable FTP,
 -Aspect of identification, of access control identification, authenication, authorization.
 -Security mechanism : 
                     cryptography
                     digital signature
                     access control
                     Data integrity
                     Authentication exchange
                     traffic padding 
                     routing control
                     notarization
-Security policy is a technical policy that is derived from a logical business policies.
-Full chain is :
               Business policies
               security  policies
               security  enforcement point/security mechanism.
-Classes of users 
                  Privilage users
                  General users
                  
-Privilage users - somebody who can change your security  policy.
-pervasive security mechanism  includes; 
                                  -event detection - that is the core of  Qradar and security intelligence.
                                 - security Audit trail- ability to collect security intelligence data  and ensure that
                                  security intelligence  data is available, is protected from unauthorized chain.
                                             - important in the forensic  world
-                                 -Trusted functionality
                                  -security label 
                                  -Security recovery
                                  
                                  


Network security Model
--------------------------
-Objective is to understand  mechanically in terms of processes and in terms of logial decomposition
-Encryption keys - allows the security  related transformation or encryption of the message.
-Security architecture
-security - managing the vulnerability and their exposure   of the risk to both assets and resources.
-Asset means something valuable  information maintained by an  an enterprise
       also means security enforcement point  that technical implementation of a security policy 
       that if it's disabled increases  the risk of the enterprise.
-Vulnerability - weakness that can be exploited and   violate a system or the information that it contains in the actual laxicon of a security profession
               - it is underemployed exploit.
-Exploit - is vulnerability thats put into play.
-Threat - is a potential violation of security.
-what need to be protected :
                         customer credit card information
                         health records 
                         bank information
                         security measures  such as the passwords.
                         
 -Security enforcment point are the technical implementation of security policies that are 
 derived from business policy.





     Organisation threats
     ---------------------------
 -Describe how the destruction corruption, modification, theft , removal , loss or disclosure of information or other resources 
 and interruption of service can constitute threats to the security of data or systems.
 -Denial of service - is predominant threat to large scale  information  processing enterprises.
 -Destruction of information destruct our security enforcement points 
 -modification - passive attack where the intruders listen and record the message and transition
 into an active attack.
 -Threat can be of two types - accidental threat without work of criminal intent
                               intential threats with intention to violate a security policy.


 
 attacks
 ---------
 -Action taken by a human with intent to violate security.
  whether it was sucessfully transformed  into an exploit.
 -It doesnt matter if it  was successful but rather it has 
   become a succesful exploit.
 -Intermediaries between the human and the enterprise system.
      protocols
      proxies
 -Disclosure attack is an attack where the intruder reveal 
   the content of the message.
 -Types of passive attack are:
               traffic analysis - does not reveal the content.
                                -ascertain rather content about the sender's actions.
                                 based on the frequency and the size of the message.
                                -during ascertain we can:
                                              -identify problem with their data architecture.
                                              -leaks
                                              -storage problems
                                              -who the sender is 
                                              -who is the receiver
                                              -the frequency, the size of them 
                                              -temporal aspect
-Masquerade - style of attack 
            - impersonation of a known or authorized or a system interestingly about or a 
              system 
            -Leads to failure of authentication and identification
 



Security architecture
------------------------------
-replay - is where copy of a legitimate messagee is captured and retransmitted later.
         -involves interception and delay.
         -it is an attack on intergrity because it is not send on timely manner .
         -the connection message is lagitmate.
 -Denial of service attacks - intruder  preventing the two communication parties from 
                             communicating or accessing the communication channel.
                             -it is availability attack because the is a timelineness factor.
                             - Intruder is stopping all messages from reaching the destination.
